# Solid-Bootstrap

#### [You can check out the demo/test page here](https://solid-libs.github.io/solid-bootstrap/)

## Overview

Solid-Bootstrap is a port of [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/).

This is a complete implementation of the Bootstrap components using SolidJS. It has no dependency on either bootstrap.js or jQuery. If you have SolidJS setup and Solid-Bootstrap installed, you have everything you need.

Refer to the original [React Bootstrap documentation](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts) to supplement this page.

## Porting approach

We have changed as little as possible while porting this code.

Principles:

- The goal is to capture all of the proven behaviour of React-Bootstrap, @restart/ui (core) and related projects.
- Keep the source file structure the same.
- Keep the source code as similar as possible to enable future commits to the original projects to also be pulled into this project.
- Enable validation of the porting approach using a side-by-side comparison between the ported SolidJS code and the original implementation.
