# Solid-Bootstrap-Core

`Solid-Bootstrap-Core` is a port of `@restart/ui` (formally `react-overlays` and a core dependancy of `React-Bootstrap`).

These are "headless" (unstyled) components, and utilities designed to integrate into any styling framework or system (not tied to Bootstrap). Components encapsulate the complicated logic and and state without being prescriptive about their look and feel.

See the [Core section of the Solid-Bootstrap documentation](https://solid-libs.github.io/solid-bootstrap/#/core/overview) for examples.
